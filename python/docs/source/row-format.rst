====================
Low level row format
====================

:Release: |version|
:Date: |today|

This reference manual describes the low level details of the binary format 
used to store each row in Wormtable. These details are not important to 
the average programmer who wishes to store data in a table. It may be 
useful to have a basic understanding of the low-level format when 
tuning for performance, and to understand the penalty associated with 
fixed and variable size columns. It should also be possible to 
build a custom interface to Wormtable in another language that supports
Berkeley DB using this data format definition.
